# Welcome to Data Pills!

Each _Data Pill_ consists in a _codelab_ styled, jupyter notebook built for Google Colabs (hosted by Google Drive), which performs advanced analysis on top of GA360, GA4, Google Ads, GMP and Third Party data and provides a **actionable** next steps.

All Data Pills were built with simplicity in mind, in a way that it should only take a couple of minutes to set the environment variables to run an analysis against your media and analytics data.
